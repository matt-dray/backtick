Is the backtick key, <kbd>`</kbd>, [missing from your keyboard](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Italian_Keyboard_layout.svg)? Has it been [mapped for use by other software](https://twitter.com/ShinyBlackShoe/status/1494987656924737537?s=20&t=QlPfudvICLEaFcyTSoE9QQ)? Scratch your backtick itch with {backtick}.

{backtick} is a very tiny R package containing functions that insert backticks into R scripts and R Markdown documents. It's intended for use as an RStudio Addin.

Install with:

```r
install.packages("remotes")  # if not yet installed
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/backtick")
```

On restart, the functions will be available to you from the RStudio Addins menu. You could also set them to keyboard shortcuts.

With these functions you can:

* insert a single backtick (<code>`</code>)
* surround selected text with backticks (<code>selection</code> becomes <code>\`selection\`</code>)
* surround selected text with backticks for execution as inline R code in an R Markdown document (<code>selection</code> becomes <code>\`r selection\`</code>)
* surround selected text with backticks for execution as an R code chunk in an R Markdown document (<code>selection</code> is surrounded by <code>\`\`\`{r}</code> above and <code>\`\`\`</code> below)
